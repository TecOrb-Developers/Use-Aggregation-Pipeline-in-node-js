### Package Summary (fc-features)
--------------------------------
Based on implementation, behaviour, feature usage etc. we have divided our codebase into multiple sub-packages. We provide a lot of useful features with charts ( for eg. export feature, crossline feature, alertmanager etc.) but without these features also charts may render. We keep all these type of file in *** fc-features *** package.
